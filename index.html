  <p class="info info-india"><span class="Arrow">&#11160;</span> Still going on right now. About 20 (and counting at time of making) days left. From a direct flight to Delhi, then a straight car ride to a family meetup, it was tiring. Met with family, the entire flight had most of my cousions on the same 3 rows. I now went to my other side of the family's house on the other side of the state, and we're buying <i><strong>Uncle Chippes</strong> and <strong>Dairy Milk chocolate</strong></i> all the way.</p>

<!-- Fort Gwalior -->
<section class="parallax parallax-2">
  <h1>Fort Gwailor</h1>
  <p class="info"><span class="Arrow">&#11161; <strong>Lots of information.</strong> It was built all the way back somewhere in the 400s-500s. And the current main palace was built in the 1400s-1500s. One of the rulers had 8 wives, which were all royal daughters of another king. But he had a ninth wive who was a milkman's daughther, and wasn't accepted by the other queens. The ninth wive instead got her own palace. Another king later on had 6 wives who had their own swingset area and place in the basement of the palace. There are a lot of bats too. After the king with 6 wives died, a decsendant after him took the wives, and since the wives didn't want to be witha different king, the burned themselves in the pool. Now many places are closed of due to British attacks and safety reasons, and the pool is closed. But it is still a beutiful place to see. (Correct me if I've misunderstood anything at <a href="https://github.com/Proking73/India-trip">the github project</a>.)</span></p>

  <h1>Sun/Sai Temple</h1>
  <p class="info"><span class="Arrow">&#11161; Daylight comes from the 3 circles or windows on the side of the tallest building where there are lots of pigeons. The sunlight then shines on a <a href="https://abpunch.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/10.jpg?w=529" target="_blank">god statue</a> where the hindus worship. The tiny buildings on the side have mini statues and information about the next to them, in the entrance area, text under a statue of a human dechiphers to "I do good deeds under the name of god." Or something like that...The entrance has beutiful palm trees and an ice-cream/pastry shop to the left. The 8 horses in the front (4 on each side) represent the horses pulling the chariot in which the sun sits in, and the wheels in the back represent the wheels of the flying chariot. this means that the sun (who is a god itself) flys across the sky in the chariot to simulate the day and night cycle.</span></p>
